### IL-12/IL-23 driven Neuroinflammation in Alzheimer´s Disease  

<br>
<br>

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is characterized by deposition of pathological amyloid β (Aβ) and Tau protein aggregates and involves chronic neuroinflammation, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Central in AD-related neuroinflammation is the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-12 (IL-12)/IL-23 pathway whose inhibition has been shown to attenuate AD pathology and cognitive defects in aged murine AD-like models. Using single-nuclei RNA sequencing of the amyloidogenic AD-like mouse model APPPS1 lacking or harboring IL-12/23 signaling we gained new insights on the IL-12/23 effector mechanism in the pathological aged murine hippocampus.

#### Summary of findings

* Neuronal and glial cell types match hippocampal regions and cellular proportions reflecting AD related changes

* IL-12/23 causes amyloid-β mediated loss of oligodendrocytes

* Expression of disease-associated markers in AD microglia is not altered in the absence of Il12b expression

* Neurons and oligodendrocytes are the important target cells of AD specific IL-12/23

* Ion homeostasis is sensitive in Subiculum region
