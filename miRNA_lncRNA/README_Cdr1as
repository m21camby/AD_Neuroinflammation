# How to extract unmapped reads?
#################################
The flag identifying an un-mapped read is the number 4.
But if you only took the BAM entries with a 4 in column 2 you would miss some unaligned reads. 
This is because BAM flags are additive. 
For example, if a read is paired (flag = 1) and unmapped (flag = 4), the flag in the BAM file would be 5 (1 + 4 = 5).
The -f argument to samtools view takes a flag and will return all of the entries that contain that flag in SAM format.
The command below uses samtools to identify all unmapped reads, pipes those SAM entries to the Unix utility cut.

# bowtie2 vs STAR for circRNAs
###############################
Bowtie2 will not distinguish between exons and introns as it will not look at annotations while aligning the reads.
If you really want to find splice junctions then you're better off with STAR

You can see that STAR accuracy is slightly better than Bowtie2, but not as good as BWA's. STAR advantage is very high speed.
To map DNA data you would need to prohibit splicing with:
--alignIntronMax 1 --alignMatesGapMax <MaxInsertSize-2*ReadLength>.
