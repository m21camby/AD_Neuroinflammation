# AD Neuroinflammation 

This repository is analysis codes of co-project with Frank Heppner lab, Il12b KO of AD mice model using snRNA-seq.  

The project aims for identifying molecular interactions in single cell scale from AD mouse model. You can check the paper from here: [Paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.25.441313v1)

# Main findings

### 2. Oligodendrocytes recued
Amyloid-β-dependent loss of `oligodendrocytes is rescued` upon deletion of IL-12/IL-23 signaling in the aged murine hippocampus



### 3. Il-12 cell type specific expression
Neurons and oligodendrocytes act as IL-12 target cells in the Aβ-rich brain

### 4. Oligodendrocytes 
Myelin forming oligodendrocytes are substantially impacted by IL-12 signaling

### 5. Biological Analysis
IL-12 signaling affects neuronal homeostasis preferentially in the subiculum of AD-like mice


### 6. Microglia
Unaltered disease-associated microglia (DAM) signature in the absence of Il12b expression in AD-like
